# THYROID-DISEASE-PREDICTION
This project leverages machine learning to predict thyroid conditions like hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. By collecting and preprocessing medical data, and training a Random Forest Classifier, we achieved high accuracy in predictions. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with hyperparameter tuning further optimizing results. The predictive model shows promise for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes, with future work focusing on data expansion, advanced techniques, and ethical considerations.
